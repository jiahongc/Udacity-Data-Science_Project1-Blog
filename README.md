# Udacity-Data-Science_Project1-Blog: Understand Worldwide Cause of Death

1. Installations: use pip install library name to install the following libraries
    - pandas: perform dataframe manipulation 
    - altair: graph maps and plots
    - vega: 
    - vega_dataset: import world map to graph
    - display: change jupyter display setting
    - jupyterlab

2. Project Motivation
    - This project is to understand world's death causes by different countries and area. This is to increase my understanding of the world and how overtime, are humans decreasing the deaths from disease and are there diseases that are we struggling to defeat.

3. File Descriptions
   - project_1.ipynb: the main jupyter notebook that contains data cleaning, data prepartion, data modeling and graphing.
   - cause_of_deaths.csv: collection of world countries cause of dealth from 1990 to 2019 from 204 countries.
   - uid.csv: contains different country's Unique Identifier, which is used to graph the country on the altair map
   - us_population.csv: population of United States from 1990 to 2019.

4. How to Interact with your project
    -Run project_1,ipynb in order. This file will contain heading and markdowns to explain each step.
